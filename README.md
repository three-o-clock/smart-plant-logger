- Designed to provide remote access control to our Smart Plant Watering System.
- Enables users to remotely track plant health and keep a check of the watering logs.
- Improvements/Additional features we are working on:-
    - **Manual Watering Button**:- To water a plant manually.
    - **Extend for multiple water pumps**:- Currently, this only supports a single water pump. We are planning to upgrade it to provide support for multiple water pumps to cover a larger area but with the same web application.
    - -# Built for `Internet of Things` coursework.
